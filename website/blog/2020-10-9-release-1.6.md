Today, weâ€™re announcing our next general release, Apollos 1.6. Featured in this release is a new and improved schema for many of our foundational data types, as well as lots of bug fixes and some cool new features.

## Upgrading your app

To start the upgrade process, run the following command within each of your Apollos app directors. For example, youâ€™ll run this command both within your `ApollosChurchApp` react-native app, as well as within your `apollos-church-api` GraphQL service:

`npx @apollosproject/upgrade-tools upgrade`

Most likely, this command will generate merge conflicts or other notices that will require manual steps. To help with this process, read through the release notes below.

## Schema Changes

## Fastlane

With this release comes the incredible mobile app deployment suite, [Fastlane](). This will give you the ability to deploy your app to the test tracks of Android and iOS without having to pay for AppCenter. It also manages your iOS Certificates and Provisioning Profiles for you (ðŸ™Œ) so you don't have to worry about generating new stuff for every member of the team. For existing apps, this will require a little work to get exactly right due to existing CD infrastructure. We would love for everyone to give it a try, so ask your question on Slack if are having trouble setting it up on your own! I'll post another guide soon on how you can migrate from your existing setup.

## Shared Secrets

This goes along with Fastlane but also comes with some other cool features. We needed a way to share Android keystore files among the group (Fastlane can't do that for you) so we are encrypting a couple of files to make them available to your CI. We also use this to share the most up to date environment variables for the API and app environments so you don't have to keep track of them in some text file or 1Password to share among the team. Create these four files:

```
- app/.env.shared                   // shared app environment variables
- api/.env.shared                   // shared API environment variables
- app/android/app/apollos.keystore  // only needed for fastlane deploys
- app/android/key.json              // only needed for fastlane deploys
```

And then encrypt them with this new command:

```
yarn secrets -e <SOME SECURE PASSWORD>
```

Now commit the new `<file>.enc` files to the repo and voila! Your secrets are on the internet ðŸ˜¬.
