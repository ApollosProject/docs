          <p>
            European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulations
            (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;)
          </p>
          <p>
            You may have certain rights under the European Union&rsquo;s GDPR
            2016/679. &nbsp;The GDPR is a complex regulatory scheme and we do
            not intend to provide every detail here. &nbsp;If interested you
            should read the GDPR and the relevant guidance provided by the
            applicable authorities for a fuller explanation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The GDPR provides the right, where applicable, to (a) access, (b)
            publication, (c) erasure, (d) restrict processing, (e) object to
            processing, (f) data portability, (g) complain to a supervisory
            authority, and (h) withdraw consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where applicable, the GDPR provides the right to confirm whether
            Company has processed your Personal Data (as defined in the GDPR)
            and, when the Company does, the right to access that data, together
            with certain other information including the purposes of the
            processing, the categories of Personal Data concerned, and the
            recipients of the Personal Data. &nbsp;Where applicable, and
            providing that we do not affect the rights and freedoms of anyone
            else, we will supply you with one copy of your Personal Data.
            &nbsp;The first copy is free. &nbsp;We may charge a reasonable fee
            for additional copies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where applicable, the GDPR provides the rights to rectify any
            inaccurate Personal Data about you and, taking into account the
            purposes of the processing, to complete any incomplete data about
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances the GDPR provides you the right to erase your
            Personal Data without undue delay, including when we no longer need
            the Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected or
            processed the Personal Data, if you withdraw your consent to
            consent-based processing, if you object to the processing of the
            Personal Data under certain rules of the GDPR, if the processing is
            for the purpose of direct marketing, and if the Personal Data have
            been unlawfully processed. &nbsp;However, the GDPR provides
            exceptions or exclusions to the right to erase, including where the
            processing is necessary for the exercise of free expression and
            information, to comply with a legal obligation, or to establish,
            exercise, or defend a legal claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances the GDPR provides the right to restrict the
            processing of your Personal Data, such as to contest the accuracy of
            the Personal Data, where the processing is unlawful but you oppose
            erasure, when we no longer need the Personal Data for the purpose of
            our processing but you require Personal Data to establish, exercise
            or defend a legal claim, and you have objected to the processing
            pending the verification of that objection. &nbsp;When processing
            has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your
            Personal Data. &nbsp;But we will process your data otherwise only
            with your consent, to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim,
            or to protect another natural or legal person&rsquo;s rights, or for
            reasons of important public interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            If applicable, the GDPR provides the right to object to our
            processing of your Personal Data on grounds relating to your
            situation, but only to the extent that the processing is necessary
            for a task carried out in the public interest or to exercise any
            official authority vested in Company, or for a legitimate interest
            pursued by Company or someone else. &nbsp;If you object, we shall
            stop processing the Personal Data unless we can demonstrate
            compelling legitimate grounds to process the information that
            override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the purpose of the
            processing is to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may object to our processing of your Personal Data for direct
            marketing purposes including profiling for direct marketing
            purposes. &nbsp;If you notify us of such an objection, we shall stop
            processing your Personal Data for that purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may object to our processing of your Personal Data for
            scientific or historical research or statistical purposes on grounds
            relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is
            necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the legal basis for our processing your Personal Data is consent
            or that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which
            you are a party, or in order to take steps at your request before
            entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by
            automatic means, you have the right to receive your Personal Data
            from us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
            &nbsp;But this right does not apply when its application will
            adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe that our processing of your Personal Data infringes
            any data-protection statute, rule or regulation, you may lodge a
            complaint with the appropriate authorities responsible for data
            protection. &nbsp;If applicable, you may lodge that complaint in the
            European Union member state of your habitual residence, your
            workplace, or the place of the alleged infringement.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent that we base our processing of your Personal Data on
            your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time. &nbsp;But
            your withdrawal of that consent will not affect the lawfulness of
            any processing we do before your withdrawal.
          </p>
          <p>
            If applicable, you may exercise any of your rights in relation to
            your Personal Data by emailing Company at{" "}
